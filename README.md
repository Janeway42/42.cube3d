# **cube3d**

cube3d is a 3D graphic design project based on the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. 
Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II (Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996) and Quake (Id Software, 1996), that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.

This is a continuation of the concepts that have been introduced in the [FDF - Wireframe](https://github.com/Janeway42/FDF_wireframe) project with the introduction of raycasting. 

Navigation:
---
- The **left** and **right** arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and right in the maze.
- The **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys must allow you to move the point of view through the maze.

Run:
------
- make
- ./cub3d map *(where map is a .cub file containing the information of the specific layout to be used)*
