[42 The Network](https://www.42network.org/) Assignment:
-----------

cube3d is a 3D graphic design project based on the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. 
Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II (Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996) and Quake (Id Software, 1996), that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.

This is a continuation of the concepts that have been introduced in the [FDF - Wireframe](https://github.com/Janeway42/FDF_wireframe) project with the introduction of raycasting. 

Navigation:
-----------
- The **left** and **right** arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and right in the maze.
- The **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys must allow you to move the point of view through the maze.

---
- Allowed external functions: open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, math library (-lm), [MiniLibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/prototypes.html)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Code format: 
------------
The code must be written in accordance to the 42 set of norms.  
These include for example a maximum of 25 lines per function, at most 80 columns per line, comments included and a maximum of five functions per file.
